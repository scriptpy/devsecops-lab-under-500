# Budget Tracker

Tracking expenses for the DevSecOps lab project. Goal is to stay under $500.

## Budget Summary

|----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Hardware | $150 | $445 | -$295 |
| Cloud Services | $200 | $0 | $200 |
| Software/Tools | $50 | $0 | $50 |

| Miscellaneous | $50 | $0 | $50 |

**Note:** Went over budget on hardware, but cloud services will use free credits so should be fine.

- Use GitHub Pages subdomain instead of buying a domain
