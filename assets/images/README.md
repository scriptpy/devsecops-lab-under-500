# Images Directory

This directory contains screenshots, diagrams, and photos for the blog posts.

## Organization

Create a subdirectory for each week:
- `week-00/` - Week 0 screenshots
- `week-01/` - Week 1 screenshots
- etc.

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive filenames:** `kali-install-step1.png` instead of `image1.png`
2. **Optimize images:** Compress large screenshots to reduce file size
3. **Add alt text:** Describe images in your blog posts for accessibility
4. **Consistent format:** Use PNG for screenshots, SVG for diagrams when possible

## Image Types

- **Screenshots:** Terminal output, GUI interfaces, dashboards
- **Diagrams:** Architecture diagrams, network topologies, flowcharts
- **Photos:** Hardware setup, physical lab environment (if applicable)
